                    +---------------------------+

Please note that this programme is distributed under the ` Shareware '
concept. For those who don't know this is how it works. You may use this
programme on a trial basis for 14 days after which you must register your
copy to continue using it.

Unregistered versions have an opening screen to prompt you to register

If you are using a registered version please do not copy it and distribute
it to other people. This would be the same as me publishing one of your
photographs and not paying for the use of it. It is a breach of copyright
and is unethical.

For development of this product to continue it must be supported by you.

Registration has several benefits:-

1. You will be able to give ideas for future version of the programme.

2. Help is available on phone if you should have a serious problem.

3. You will help to meet a small part of the cost of developing this
programme and thus encourage me to improve and extend it.

This programme has taken around 2000 hours to develop over around 18 months.

Please make the effort to register your copy!

For a single user, registration is NZ$40. Please write or call for
details of club or site liscence fees.

DOF may not be sold nor may it be included with any package that is sold
    without a negotiated distribution license.

UNREGISTERED versions of DOF may be freely distributed, so long as ALL files,
that is DOF.EXE, DOF.INI, DOF.DOC, are provided in unaltered form and only
a minimal fee is charged.

    Fill in and send the registration form on following page to

System Requirements.
---------------------
DOF should run on the IBM PS/2, PC/AT, PC/XT, PC, PC/Jr, and on IBM 100%
compatible computers.

MINIMUM requirements are:

# MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 2.0 or greater.

# 256 KB of memory

# Any colour or monochrome monitor with an 80-column display.
  DOF will change video mode if it has to in order to run.

# 60 KB of disk space.

Files needed.
-------------
DOF.EXE
and DOF.INI     if you wish to change DOFs default configuration

Quickstart.
-----------

Just type DOF from the A:\> prompt and follow the menus.
Press F1 for help.

Setup.
------

The best way is to copy DOF to its own directory on your hard disk and then
run it from your hard disks menu system.

UNDERSTANDING DOF
=================

The concept of DOF or depth of field of acceptable sharpness ( `depth of
field' for short ) is well known among photograhers. How to increase it or
decrease it is a simple matter of changing apperture tied with a change in
shutter speed. Most lenses come with a scale engraved on the lens. Some
lenses unfortunately do not come with this scale. On occasion there is also
a need to use a different DOF scale, especially if BIG enlargments are
needed.

This programme fills both those needs. The charts that DOF creates can be
printed on any printer that suuports an IBM compatable mode. Some
characters will only print correctly in an IBM compatable mode.

Where possible I have included a screen shot to make this manual a bit
easier to understand.

Please ensure that your printer is set to an IBM compatable mode. This is
usually a case of changing a little switch on most non-IBM printers. Failure
to do this will cause some characters in this file to print incorrectly.


       THE DOF PROGRAMME.
====================================

DOF should run on all IBM and most fully compatable machines.
There will be some machines which are not hardware compatable and these will
not run DOF.

If you have a CGA card which has the `snow' problem see the configuration
heading in this documentation.

If you want to run DOF under WINDOWS or O/S 2 there is also an option to use the
machines BIOS for screen writing. See config information for details.

NB. DOF has NOT been tested under WINDOWS but should run.

There is always an ACTIVE window in DOF. This is the window where your typing
on the keyboard will have an effect. The active window is always the one with
a bright edge. Run the programme....seeing is understanding.


The Main menu.

This is the opening menu of the DOF programme.

DOF Chart.
----------

You will simply be asked for a focal length. After supplying it press <ENTER>
and the chart will be written to a file in the same directory as where you
started DOF from. Some of the figures produced in the charts will be of
accademic interest only and have be been included for completeness.

This is what the some lines of a chart look like...

The chart is headed with the values of Focal Length and Circle of confusion
that were used.
The numbers along the top vertical row are F stops
The numbers down the left most column are the distances.

The HyDis row refres to the HYPERFOCAL DISTANCE for that f stop. If the lense
were set to this distance then the depth of field would extend from HALF that
distance to infinity.


File Menu.
==========

After making a chart select this menu. You will be presented with a sub menu
and a list of available files thus:-

 +---[ Main Menu ]----+       +[ Available Files ]+

           |    Exit      |
           +--------------+

The files that are available for operations are listed in the box on the
right of the Files Menu.

View
------

This lets you have a look at the highlighted file.
Use the up or down arrows, Page up or down, or Home and End to view the file.
A horizontal highlight bar, which is controlled by the left and right arrow
keys, aids the reading of figures.

Copy
-----

Same as DOS's copy command. When this option is selected you will be prompted
for a path to copy to. This can be almost any legal DOS path.

Move
-----

Same as above except the file is actually moved from the DOF directory
to where ever you enter. Files cannot however be moved between disk drives.

Delete
-------
DOF will ask you if you are sure and will then delete the highlighted file if
you reply Y ( for yes ).

Print
------

This option when selected will print the highlighted file on the printer
connected to the first printer port on your machine.

Exit
-----

Will return you to the main menu.


 Change Defaults
===================

Selecting this option will present you with the menu shown below.

          +---------------------+

Circle of confusion
--------------------

The maximum allowable circle of confusion can be set between
1 micrometre ( 1 �m ) and 1 millimetre ( 1 mm ). The default is 33 �m which is
generally accepted as the figure to use for the 35 mm format. It can be changed
to other ammounts to meet diferent requirements. For example other formats
require a larger figure.


F Stop List
------------

Select the list of F stops that DOF uses for it's charts. You have three choices

...Whole F stops  eg.  1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0, 5.6  etc
   Half f stops   eg.  4.7, 5.6, 6.8, 8.0, 9.5, 11.0, 13.5, 16.0  etc
   Third f stops  eg.  1.0, 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2   etc

The default is whole f stops.

Distances List
---------------

There are also three list of Distances available.

general distances..range from   0.02 metre  to  10 metres
macro distances....range from   0.01 metre  to  1.00 metre
tele distances.....range from   10 metres  to 1000 metres

Exit
